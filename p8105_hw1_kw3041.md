## Homework 1

Below, I will be loading packages and dataset needed for solving the
homework 1.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

In order to answer the first question, I am going to take a look at the
dataset to assess it.

``` r
head(early_january_weather)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 15

    ## # ℹ 4 more variables: precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>,
    ## #   time_hour <dttm>

## Problem 1.

This data includes variables such as `temp`, which is measured in
Fahrenheit; `dewp` which is a measure of dewpoint; `humid` for relative
humidity; `wind_speed`, and a couple more variables.

## Checking the structure of “early_january_weather” tibble:

The early_january_weather dataset contains following number of rows:

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

The early-january_weather dataset contains the following numner of
columns:

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

The mean temperature of this dataset is:

``` r
mean(early_january_weather[["temp"]], na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212
