## Homework 1 

Below, I will be loading packages and dataset needed for solving the homework 1. 

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

In order to answer the first question, I am going to take a look at the dataset to assess it. 

```{r}
head(early_january_weather)
```

## Problem 1. 

This data includes variables such as `temp`, which is measured in Fahrenheit; `dewp` which is a measure of dewpoint; `humid` for relative humidity; `wind_speed`, and a couple more variables. 

## Checking the structure of "early_january_weather" tibble: 

The early_january_weather dataset contains following number of rows: 
```{r}
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

The early-january_weather dataset contains the following numner of columns:
```{r}
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

The mean temperature of this dataset is:
```{r}
mean(early_january_weather[["temp"]], na.rm = TRUE)
```
